   * letting it, and the card list it contains, overflow — and it's that
   * overflow the surrounding `overflow-y-auto` scroll region depends on to
   * ever show a scrollbar in the first place. Leaving `min-height` at its
   * default `auto` keeps the item's automatic minimum size pinned to its
   * own content's natural height, so `flex-grow` can still expand it to
   * fill leftover space when content is light (the empty state this flag
   * was built for), while a heavy card list still refuses to shrink below
   * what it actually needs — overflowing the scroll region exactly like

              `!itemsFirst` arrangement above, where `items` itself is a
              sticky rail sitting right at the scroll region's bottom edge
              (carrying its own fade, unchanged), `itemsFirst` moves Home to
              the TOP and Settings out of the scroll region entirely (into
              `footer`, a sibling AFTER this whole wrapper) — so the scroll
              region's bottom edge has no sticky rail of its own to anchor a
              fade to anymore, just the raw `overflow-hidden` clip edge of
              this non-scrolling wrapper. Attached here (not inside
              `listScrollRef`) specifically so it stays fixed at the visible
              viewport edge rather than scrolling away with the list — this
              wrapper's own `relative` (added above) is what lets it anchor
              to that. `z-20`, same reasoning as the two rails' own z-index
              note above. Gated on `listHasOverflow` (not scroll-position —
              same established convention) and paired with `header`'s own
              `pb-8` reserved space above so it never lands on the last
              card's real bottom edge, only that reserved padding. */}

/**
 * Renders a `NavItem[]` the exact way `LeftNav`'s own item rail does — a
 * full `TreeMenu` when `expanded`, single icon-only buttons (with
 * tooltips + the same active-bar treatment) when collapsed. Exported so a
 * consumer can render an ADDITIONAL nav row matching the rail's own
 * styling somewhere OTHER than the `items` prop — e.g. inside `footer`, so
 * a single item (Settings, say) can be genuinely pinned to the true
 * bottom of the aside (outside the scrollable region entirely, per
 * `footer`'s own doc comment) while `items` holds a different item (Home,
 * say) positioned elsewhere via `itemsFirst`. Pass it straight to
 * `footer` — `injectExpanded` already clones the right `expanded` value
 * onto it in both overlay and inline mode, same as it does for any other
 * `footer` content, so there's no need to read `open`/`hoverOpen`
 * yourself. Deliberately a separate, independent copy of `LeftNav`'s own
 * internal icon-only rendering (not a shared extraction) — keeps this a
 * zero-risk addition that can't affect `LeftNav`'s own existing rail
 * rendering for any other consumer.
