// VoiceCallControls — ported into lyra-ui from agent-next-gen-v3's own
// `agent-next-gen-voice-call-controls.tsx` (that file's full build history
// is preserved below, unchanged) so every consuming app gets the same
// call-control bar instead of hand-copying it. Two changes made in the
// port itself, beyond the mechanical import-path updates: (1) the Record
// button's "disabled while masking" `Tooltip` is no longer reachable-proof
// — see `recordDisabled`'s own doc comment further down for why the
// original's native `disabled` attribute made that explanation
// unreachable by hover OR keyboard, and how this fixes it; (2) the
// unmatched-caller avatar fallback (no `customerInitials`) swapped from a
// bespoke purple circle + `Plus` glyph to this design system's own
// standard "primary" avatar look (same `bg-lyra-bg-primary`/generic `User`
// icon `InteractionNavItem`'s own avatar already falls back to) — see
// `customerInitials`'s own doc comment.
//
// VoiceCallControls — the fixed-to-the-bottom-of-the-content-area call
// toolbar for an active VOICE channel (Hold/Mute/Mask/Record/Keypad/Add
// video/Hang Up), per explicit request/reference screenshot. Sits in
// the exact spot `InteractionComposer` occupies for a chat channel — a
// `shrink-0` sibling directly below `InteractionTranscript`, in each of the
// three page components' own "voice has no composer" branch (see that
// branch's own doc comment, AgentNextGenPage.tsx/AgentWorkspace2WithDeskPage
// .tsx/AgentWorkspaceAdvancedPage.tsx) — so a live voice call gets this bar
// in that exact slot instead of nothing.
//
// Every button here except Hang Up is purely decorative/local-state (Hold/
// Mute/Mask/Record/Add video each just toggle their own icon and fire a
// toast; Keypad opens a small popover dialpad) — there's no real telephony
// backing any of this in the prototype, same "fake it with a toast"
// convention every other placeholder control in this app already follows
// (Send Transcript/Download Transcript/Translate Messages, etc.). Hang Up
// is the one exception: it's wired to a real `onHangUp` callback (the
// caller closes this channel, same as picking "Closed" from the status
// popover) since ending the call is the one action here an agent actually
// depends on to move on to logging an outcome.
//
// This bar used to carry THREE renderings — a WIDE two-row centered card, a
// COMPACT icon-only row, and a `stretch` single-row variant of the wide
// buttons for Phase 1/Phase 2 — auto-toggling between wide/compact via a
// `ResizeObserver` self-measuring this bar's own rendered width against a
// 768px breakpoint (a pattern `InteractionTranscript`'s own
// `transcriptNarrow`/`transcriptBubbleFullWidth`, agent-next-gen-
// transcript.tsx, and `ScheduleToolbar`'s own `containerRef`/`isWide`/
// `isCompact`, SchedulePanel.tsx, also use). Per an explicit bug report
// ("opened the details panel with the left nav closed, opened the left
// nav, then closing the details panel again didn't resize the bar back")
// and the explicit follow-up fix request that replaced trying to chase that
// bug further ("just take the existing compact version — stretch it the
// full width of the container and remove media queries"): all of that
// responsive machinery — the `ResizeObserver`/`isCompact` state, the wide
// two-row card, and the `stretch` single-row card — is gone. This bar now
// always renders what used to be the COMPACT (icon-only) JSX, unconditionally,
// stretched to fill whatever width its container gives it (`w-full` on the
// card below AND on the outer full-bleed wrapper — see that wrapper's own
// doc comment for why both levels need it explicitly rather than leaning on
// ambient flex stretch — no `max-w`/`mx-auto` cap) instead of only kicking
// in below a measured breakpoint. Below, every main control still drops its
// visible label for a hover/focus `Tooltip` (`CompactCallControlButton`),
// the timer still shows its "MM:SS" digits next to a Clock icon, and
// Volume/Transcript still trail in their own leading/trailing flex slots —
// none of that content changed, only the "which rendering, and how wide"
// logic around it. `stretch` stays as an accepted prop (default `false`)
// purely so Phase 1/Phase 2's existing call sites don't need to change
// their JSX — it no longer affects anything rendered here.
//
// Per a later explicit follow-up request/reference screenshot ("make the
// voice controls larger and label the buttons again"), every main control
// (Hold/Mask/Record/Keypad/Transcript/Volume/Mute/Add video) switched back
// from that icon-only `CompactCallControlButton` treatment to a labeled
// icon-over-text button instead — bigger tap target, and the label is now
// always-visible text again rather than only surfacing on hover/focus via
// `Tooltip`. This ISN'T a return to the old three-way wide/compact/stretch
// responsive split this file just spent the paragraph above removing —
// there's still exactly one rendering, it's just the LABELED one now
// instead of the icon-only one, still unconditionally stretched to its
// container's width. `WideCallControlButton` (below) — defined back when
// this file had that old wide rendering, but unused since it was removed —
// is what got reactivated for this, reworked to compose as a `Tooltip`/
// `Popover` trigger the same way `CompactCallControlButton` already does
// (see its own doc comment for why that requires `forwardRef`+`...rest`
// rather than a plain named-prop function). `CompactCallControlButton`
// itself is left defined but unused below — nothing left in this file
// calls it now that every control uses the labeled button instead — kept
// rather than deleted in case a genuinely narrow/compact rendering is ever
// wanted again later. Hang Up is the one control excluded from this
// change, per explicit request ("keep the End Call button filled red") —
// it stays the same solid-red `Button` it already was (see that render
// site's own doc comment), just bumped from `size="default"` to `size="lg"`
// so it still reads as proportionate next to the now-taller labeled
// buttons beside it.
//
// Per a later explicit follow-up request/reference screenshot ("make the
// end call button the same height as the mute and add video buttons and add
// the customer avatar. Add the name / number/email above the timer"): the
// trailing dark cluster (Mute/Add video/End Call) switched from
// `items-center` to `items-stretch` and End Call's fixed `size="lg"` height
// (h-9) got overridden to `h-auto`, so it now stretches to match whichever
// of Mute/Add video is tallest (their own `WideCallControlButton` shape is
// already `h-auto`, sized by content) instead of sitting short and centered
// next to them — no hardcoded pixel height to keep in sync if either of
// those buttons' own height ever changes. Separately, the leading slot
// gained an optional avatar chip + identity line (`customerLabel`/
// `customerInitials`, see their own doc comments on `VoiceCallControlsProps`
// below) stacked above the existing elapsed timer, per the reference
// screenshot's small purple circle + phone number/name sitting above the
// call duration. The avatar's purple background reuses this app's own
// existing "Voice channel = purple" accent convention (see
// `CHANNEL_TYPE_TAG_VARIANT`/`CHANNEL_TYPE_ICON_COLOR_CLASS`,
// agent-next-gen-contact-history.tsx and channel-row.tsx, both already
// purple for Voice) rather than inventing a new color. Its glyph is a
// generic `Plus` fallback (this design system's `interaction-nav-item.tsx`
// already falls back to a generic icon — there just a person outline —
// when there's no real contact match; `Plus` reads closer to the reference
// screenshot's unmatched-quickdial-number case, see `Interaction.id`'s own
// `quickdial:<number>` doc comment) shown in white — an explicit follow-up
// clarified this should be white, not the icon's original black/dark
// tone — with real initials (`customerInitials`) taking over instead once a
// caller has a genuine contact match, same "initials over generic icon
// once known" split that avatar convention already uses.

            screenshot's own left-to-right shape is: a timer alone at the
            far left with a large gap after it, a centered cluster of
            lighter/decorative controls, a divider, a visibly DARKER
            mute+video pair, then a large red "End Call" button anchored to
            the far right. `justify-between` on this row still does the
            bookending work (leading/trailing slots `shrink-0`, middle slot
            `flex-1`+`justify-center` claims whatever space is left and
            centers its own contents within it) — same mechanism the old
            two-slot layout already used, just with a third slot added and
            the controls redistributed among all three. */}

              timer/status leading the WHOLE bar on the far left instead.
              Digits/width behavior unchanged (see the comment that used to
              sit here for the "why" of the fixed `w-[34px]` digit width and
              `tabular-nums`) — only its position moved, and its own
              trailing divider is dropped since it's now alone in the
              leftmost slot with nothing to its left to separate from.
              Per explicit follow-up request ("when record is enabled make
              the clock icon on the left of the timer a red badge"): the
              leading glyph now swaps from the plain `Clock` outline to a
              solid red `Circle` — the SAME icon+fill/text color pair
              (`fill-lyra-status-critical-strong text-lyra-status-critical-
              strong`) the Record button below already uses for its own
              filled/active state, so this reuses an existing "recording"
              treatment instead of inventing a new badge style — whenever
              `recording` is on, reverting to the plain clock the instant
              recording stops. Per an explicit follow-up request ("make the
              red dot next to the timer pulse or animate when recording"):
              `animate-pulse` (Tailwind's own built-in fade in/out keyframe,
              already relied on elsewhere in this app for "something's
              live" affordances) is added here so the dot itself breathes
              while recording, on top of its plain solid-red look — the
              Record button's own filled-red `Circle` (just below, in the
              decorative cluster) intentionally keeps its plain static fill:
              this pulsing is specific to the badge this request named, not
              a blanket "recording" treatment applied everywhere red shows
              up in this bar. */}

              (originally `justify-center`, then briefly `justify-end` per
              an explicit follow-up request — "move the middle buttons to
              the right" — so this cluster sat flush against the divider/
              dark-cluster/End Call group that follows it). Per a LATER
              explicit follow-up request/reference screenshot ("center the
              hold through volume buttons when the call controls expand and
              add separators to the left and right around these buttons"):
              back to `justify-center` — so this cluster centers within
              whatever open space the leading/trailing `shrink-0` slots
              leave it once this bar is wider than its own contents need —
              now bracketed by its own leading/trailing dividers (the first
              child below, and the one right after `CompactVolumeButton`
              further down) instead of relying on the trailing dark
              cluster's divider to read as this group's right edge. Those
              two dividers are deliberately INSIDE this centered flex item
              (not floated at the leading/trailing slot boundaries) so they
              travel with the cluster as it centers, staying flush against
              Hold/Volume at any container width rather than drifting away
              from them into the open space `justify-center` creates on
              either side. `items-stretch` (was `items-center`) is what lets
              those two divider `span`s reach this row's full height via
              their own `self-center`, same reasoning as the trailing dark
              cluster's own divider (see that slot's own comment) — every
              `WideCallControlButton` here is already `h-auto`/content-sized
              regardless of the row's own `align-items`, so this doesn't
              change their height. Mute itself is still OUT of this cluster,
              in the trailing dark group below — see that slot's own
              comment for why. */}

          {/* End Call — per explicit request ("make the leave button big
              and red and have it say 'end call'"): this used to be a plain
              icon-only `CompactCallControlButton` with `critical` styling
              (a small red PhoneOff glyph, label only reachable via
              `Tooltip`) same as every other control in this bar. It's now a
              real lyra-ui `Button` instead — `variant="destructive"` is
              this design system's own solid-red/filled treatment (see
              button.tsx: `bg-lyra-bg-destructive` + `text-lyra-fg-on-
              primary`, the same token pair every other destructive action
              in this app already uses). Label is now always-visible text
              ("End Call") next to the icon instead of hidden behind a hover
              `Tooltip`, so no `Tooltip` wrapper here anymore — a `Button`
              with visible text content already has its own accessible
              name. Size was originally `lg` (h-9) to read as "big" against
              the surrounding h-8 icon buttons; per an explicit follow-up
              request ("make the red button smaller") this became `default`
              (h-8) instead, matching the row's own then-h-8 icon buttons
              exactly. Bumped back to `lg` (h-9) here per a later explicit
              follow-up request/reference screenshot ("make the voice
              controls larger... keep the End Call button filled red") —
              every OTHER control in this bar just grew from a flat h-8
              icon-only button to a taller icon+label column
              (`WideCallControlButton`, `h-auto` with `py-2` — roughly h-16
              in practice), so `default` would now read as visibly SMALLER
              than its neighbors instead of matching them. Still
              `variant="destructive"` (filled red, unchanged) and still its
              own real `Button` with a visible label — only the size moved,
              exactly as asked.
              Per a later explicit follow-up request ("make the end call
              button the same height as the mute and add video buttons"):
              `size="lg"`'s own fixed `h-9` is overridden here to `h-auto`
              (via `cn()`'s tailwind-merge, same "last one wins" mechanism
              `wrap`'s own doc comment in button.tsx describes) so this
              button no longer sits at a fixed height while its neighbors
              have grown taller — instead it now stretches to match
              whichever of Mute/Add video is tallest, via this row's own
              `items-stretch` (see the divider's own comment just above for
              why it needed an explicit `self-center` once the row stopped
              using `items-center`). `size="lg"` is still passed for its
              padding/typography, just no longer for its height.
              Per explicit follow-up request ("when end call is clicked
              transition the end call button to a hanging up state
              (disabled)"): once `isEnding` is set (`handleHangUp` above),
              this button disables itself (lyra-ui's own `disabled:opacity-
              40`/`disabled:pointer-events-none`, same dimmed-and-inert look
              every other disabled control in this bar already gets — see
              button.tsx) and swaps its icon+label for an inverse `Spinner`
              + "Hanging Up..." — the one visible cue (besides the rest of
              the bar disabling alongside it) that the click registered
              while `onHangUp` itself is deferred behind the exit
              animation (see `isEnding`'s own doc comment above). */}
