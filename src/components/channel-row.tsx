 * per explicit correction, this action isn't a warning at all, just
 * "remove this agent from the assignment," and sharing `TriangleAlert`
 * with the SLA-severity tab icon (`ChannelTab`'s own `tabIcon`, further
 * down this file) made the two easy to visually confuse on a busy tab
 * bar/kebab menu).
 *
 * Built as functions (not flat consts) so "Unassign & Dismiss" — the one

 * `InteractionNavItem`'s own `onDismiss` prop. That action ends the whole
 * interaction, not just this one channel, so it's threaded down from the
 * card level rather than something a channel row decides on its own. A
 * `menuItems` override on `InteractionChannel` still replaces this whole
 * list, same as before — the override is the consumer's responsibility to
 * wire up, `onDismiss` only ever applies to the *default* menu.
 *
 * "consult-transfer"/"outcome" still live in these lists (unchanged) since
 * `ChannelTab`/`ChannelToggle` (the record-header tab bar) both build their
 * own default kebab from these same two functions and still want both
 * actions in that dropdown. `ChannelRow` (below — the row `InteractionNavItem`
 * renders per open channel) is the one exception: per explicit request, IT
 * promotes these same two actions out of its own kebab into two standalone
 * icon buttons to the kebab's immediate left instead, so see that

      {/* Trailing button cluster — Consult/Transfer, Outcome, and the kebab
          — grouped together as siblings in ONE wrapper so all three read as
          a single unit in the code, with `gap-0` applied consistently
          across the cluster: no space between Consult/Transfer and
          Outcome, and no space between Outcome and the kebab either.

          The elapsed clock+time text used to live on THIS row too, between
          the chip and this cluster — moved down to the preview line below
          (per explicit follow-up) since that's what was colliding with
          these buttons on a narrow row in the first place; with the timer
          gone, this row only ever has to fit the chip plus this cluster,
          which always leaves room (removing an entire category of
          truncate/clip-on-collision logic this row used to need).

          `ml-auto` pushes this wrapper to the row's far right on its own —
          no intermediate `flex-1` spacer needed now that there's no timer
          text between it and the chip to share space with. `shrink-0`
          keeps its width to just the kebab's natural size, since the two
          ghost buttons inside it are `absolute` and contribute nothing to
          that sizing (same "costs nothing while hidden" property rule #55
          established, still true here — this is what keeps the kebab from
          jumping around based on whether the ghost buttons are showing).

          The ghost-button overlay is positioned `right-full` (not
          `right-0`) relative to THIS wrapper — `right-full` (right:100%)
          plants the overlay's right edge exactly at the wrapper's LEFT
          edge (i.e., immediately before the kebab, touching it with zero
          gap), then the overlay extends further left by its own natural
          width (the two buttons + their now-zero internal gap). On a
          narrow row this can still visually land on top of the CHIP now
          (nothing else left to collide with) — accepted per this same
          follow-up, since the whole point of moving the timer was to stop
          worrying about what the overlay might cover.

          The overlay `div` itself carries no background (see rule #56 —
          these are true ghost `variant="icon"` buttons, no border, no
          resting-state fill, just `hover:bg-lyra-state-hover`/`active:
          bg-lyra-state-pressed` and `rounded-lyra-sm` baked into the
          variant). `pointer-events-none opacity-0` + `group-hover:
          pointer-events-auto group-hover:opacity-100` is the same
          invisible-until-hovered technique used throughout this file. Both
          the overlay and the kebab are gated on `showMenu` together, same
          as before. Per explicit follow-up, `showMenu={false}` no longer
          just leaves this whole cluster empty — see the close-button
          `else` branch right after this block, and `onDismiss`'s own doc
          comment above. */}

/* ── ChannelTab ──
 * One open channel rendered as a `Tab` — e.g. the "active conversation area"
 * tab bar under a record-header `PageHeader` (see `AgentNextGenTemplate
 * .stories.tsx`'s `activeInteraction` block), one tab per
 * `TrackedChannel`/`InteractionChannel`, kept in sync with which row is
 * "current" on the matching `InteractionNavItem` card via that component's
 * `currentChannelKey`/`onCurrentChannelChange` props — both should be driven
 * by the same piece of parent state (e.g. `ActiveInteraction.currentChannelId`)
 * so clicking a tab here and clicking a row on the card either update the
 * same thing. Not a full "tab list" wrapper — the consumer still renders its
 * own `<TabList>` around one `ChannelTab` per channel, same as any other set
 * of `Tab`s, and that `<TabList>` should just turn on `overflowMenu` like any
 * other tab bar (per its own standing default — see `tabs.tsx`) — no special
 * wrapper class needed. This used to shed each tab's own address/label text
 * at its own narrower 480px/320px breakpoints via a dedicated
 * `.lyra-channel-tab-list-wrap` container query instead of collapsing into
 * an overflow menu; that bespoke behavior was removed in favor of the
 * standard "active tab + N More" pattern every other `TabList` already uses
 * (see PROJECT_SUMMARY.md's "ChannelTab no longer has its own collapse
 * strategy" entry). A `Tooltip` on every tab always surfaces the type
 * label + address together on its own top line (e.g. "Email |
 * david.brown@example.com"), plus a second, smaller line with this
 * channel's current status and how long it's been since the customer last
 * spoke (`statusLabel`/`lastCustomerContactLabel`) when either is on hand
 * — the tooltip is the one place the type label is always paired with the
 * address, even though the tab FACE itself normally shows `address` alone
 * (replacing the type label there — see that prop's own doc comment, and
 * `showAddressOnFace` for opting a consumer back to the plain type label

 * behavior (built on the exact same `CHANNEL_TYPE_META`/`buildDigitalMenu
 * Items`/`buildVoiceMenuItems`/`KebabMenuButton`/`Tooltip` pieces `ChannelTab`
 * itself uses, not a re-derivation of any of it), just styled as a
 * `ToggleGroup`-style segmented pill instead of a `Tab`'s underline —
 * requested specifically for `PageHeader`'s `titlePrefix` slot (a compact
 * cluster to the left of the title, where an underlined tab strip reads
 * oddly against a single-line header row the way it doesn't in a full
 * `TabList` beneath one).
 *
 * Not built on `ToggleGroup` itself: that component's generic `items`
 * array renders each item's `label` inside the one real `<button>` it
 * owns, and a channel toggle's kebab is itself an interactive control —
 * nesting it in there would be a button-inside-a-button, the same reason
 * `Tab`'s own `menuItems` slot renders `KebabMenuButton` with `as="span"`
 * instead of letting it default to a real nested `<button>` (see that
 * prop's own doc comment in kebab-menu-button.tsx). `ChannelToggle` reuses
 * `ToggleGroup`'s exact visual classes by hand (selected/unselected pill
 * treatment, `role="radio"`/`aria-checked`) so the two read as the same
 * design-system control, and `ChannelToggleGroup` reuses its outer shell
 * classes (`role="radiogroup"`, rounded bordered strip, dividers between
 * items) the same way `TabList` is the shell `ChannelTab` needs but never
 * duplicates itself. */
