/* ── Types ──
   Was "available" | "busy" | "away" | "offline" — "away" was dropped
   (three real states plus Offline was one too many to tell apart at a
   glance, color-only) and "busy" renamed to "unavailable" to match the
   same terminology `AgentDashboard`'s "Unavailable Agents" badge already
   uses (see agent-dashboard.tsx) — same word, same red/critical color,
   now also the same icon. "offline" was dropped too, per explicit
   request: just Available and Unavailable for now.

   Per a later explicit request, 15 more granular "unavailable, and here's
   why" reason codes were added on top of that — real call-center ACD/ACW
   reason-code vocabulary (lunch, break, coaching, system down, etc.), so
   `AgentProfile`'s own status search/Favorites/scrolling menu has enough
   real rows to stress-test with instead of just the two. Every one of
   these 15 reuses `"unavailable"`'s own icon/color in `statusConfig`
   below verbatim (same `Minus` glyph, same critical/red badge) rather than
   getting a distinct glyph each — per that same request, they're meant to
   read as "flavors of Unavailable," not 15 new semantically-distinct
   states `StatusIcon`/`Avatar`/anything else in this file would need to
   tell apart. Add a real per-reason icon later if that ever changes.

   `"working"`, per a later explicit request ("when an agent is in a call
   the status should change to 'working' — do not add this as a selectable
   status"): a SYSTEM-DRIVEN status, not a manual one. Deliberately left
   OUT of `allStatuses` below (the list the status menu actually renders),
   so it never appears in Favorites, "All Codes," or search results, and an
   agent can never pick it by hand — only a consumer's own `status` prop
   ever sets it (e.g. an effect watching for a live voice call, see
   `AgentNextGenPage.tsx`'s own `isOnVoiceCall`). Still a completely normal
   member of this union otherwise — `statusConfig`/`StatusIcon`/`Avatar`
   all handle it exactly like every selectable status — the ONLY thing that
   makes it unpickable is its absence from `allStatuses`. */
