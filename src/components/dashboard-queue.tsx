/* ── DashboardQueue ──
   A row of queue-type summary widgets — e.g. "Digital" / "Inbound Voice" /
   "Voicemail" / "Work Item" on a contact center home screen, each showing
   how many Skills and Contacts are queued. Two interchangeable layouts,
   same `items` data, picked with `variant`:

   1. "cards" (default) — each queue renders as its own standalone
      `DashboardCard` (a "hero" `Icon` for the queue's own type — Digital,
      Inbound Voice, Voicemail, Work Item, etc. — + name + "Wait Time:
      {wait}" header, Skills/Contacts as "contained" metrics) — no shared
      enclosing backdrop; each card carries its own `neutral-subtle`
      surface. Laid
      out via `.lyra-container-grid-wrap`/`.lyra-container-grid` (see
      lyra-tokens.css) — the same CSS container-query pattern the home
      tab's Activity/Performance/Productivity row uses — so this row
      collapses to a stacked column once its own available width gets
      tight, same as that one, rather than staying a fixed N-column grid
      that squeezes its cards (and their metric numbers/labels) into an
      unreadably narrow space. Clicking a card selects it
      (`selectedId`/`onSelect`, controlled/uncontrolled like `FilterChip`'s
      own selection prop) — the selected card gets the `info-strong` (blue)
      `Container` treatment instead. Built for a click-to-drill-down
      pattern (e.g. opening a side panel with that queue's own
      sub-queues), but `DashboardQueue` itself only reports the selection;
      anything opened as a result of it is the consumer's concern, not
      this component's.
   2. "accordion" — the same queue list as expandable `Accordion` rows
      instead of a card grid: icon + name + "{contactsCount} contacts in
      queue" / "Wait: {wait}" subhead, with the Skills/Contacts metrics
      moved into the row's `endSlot` (same `Container` + `Metric`
      composition as the "cards" variant uses, just smaller and inline).
      Each item's optional `content` becomes what's shown when its row
      expands — e.g. a table of that queue's individual interactions.

   Both variants compose existing atoms (`DashboardCard`/`Metric`,
   `Accordion`, `Container`) rather than re-deriving card/row markup, per
   "composition over reimplementation." See the "QueueCards" and
   "QueueAccordion" stories, each modeled on a specific reference
   screenshot. */
